    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">
      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
      greater than 250 words
    </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
      For a client I would advise them to read up on how important security for
      their product is. I would suggest they read about Cross-Site Scripting,
      Cross-Site request forgeries and SQL injections as these are the most
      common ones. 2FA (two factor authorization) is becoming a lot more common,
      and it works really well when trying to protect your accounts/logins.
      Thinking about what networks you connect to, if your passwords are strong
      is also very important. Sanitization of your files/data is also important
      as that makes it so the system will only accept the right formats you have
      set it to use.
